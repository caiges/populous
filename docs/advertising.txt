Advertising
===========

This software is the result of several revisions of the advertising
system for `The Daily Bruin`_.  It has been designed to fill the
needs of our advertising department while meeting the demands of
us the programmers.

While the initial release was only designed to serve ads for
`The Daily Bruin`_, this is the first release which has been designed
to work across *ALL* of our websites.

.. admonition:: Note

    Django's single database limitation forced us to come up with some
    workarounds in order to get this to work the way we desired, but
    we think we've come up with a pretty solid solution.
