.. module:: inlines

The inlines application in Populous has two main concepts; using the inline system in your own application and creating your own inline to be used by other applications.  In Populous, both the ``news`` app and the ``blogs`` app use ``InlineField``, while apps like ``polls`` and ``locations`` define their own inlines by subclassing ``BaseInline``.

Giving your application the ability to use preexisting inlines is very simple.  All you need to do is define a field that is an instance of  ``inlines.InlineField``.  Under the surface ``InlineField`` is a subclass of ``django.models.XMLField`` with added functionality that integrates with the rest of the inlines system.

Creating an inline that other applications can use is also very straight forward.  In the most basic case, all you need to do is define a subclass of ``inlines.Inline``.  In fact, the processes of creating an inline is pretty similar to defining a subclass of ``ModelAdmin``, when working with Django's admin interface.

.. Note::
    By default the inlines application is designed to work with the ``django.contrib.admin`` application.  However, there's nothing stopping you from using it elsewhere.  These docs should help you get a grasp on how the application works and how you can extend it to meet your needs.


Overview
========

The application deals with the following concepts:

.. glossary::

    Inline
        A class for creating your own inlines that other applications can use.
    
    InlineForm
        A subclass of ``Form`` for creating a form capable of editing your custom inline.
    
    InlineField
        A class that can be added to your models to give them the ability to use inlines that have been installed.

Quick Example
-------------

Let's pretend you have an application called ``polls`` and you would like to allow your users to be able to add a ``Poll`` object into the body of a news ``Story``.  This example inline defines a ``PollInline`` which takes advantage of the included ``ModelInline`` class::

    from populous import inlines

    class PollInline(inlines.ModelInline):
        name = 'poll'
        model = Poll

You would place this code into a file called ``inlines.py`` inside of your ``polls`` directory.  Here is an example of what your application layout might look like::

    polls/
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        inlines.py
        models.py
        views.py
        urls.py

When you run ``syncdb`` your newly created ``PollInline`` will be automatically registered with the system (alternatively you can run a management command; more on that later).  If you log into the admin site and head over to inlines, you'll see that it has been automatically detected and is now ready for use by any ``InlineField`` instance.  You should see a screen similar to this:

Inline Class
============

.. currentmodule:: inlines.base

All inlines are subclasses of ``inlines.base.Inline``.  	

.. class:: Inline()

The base ``Inline`` class should be subclassed to create you own inline.  Every ``Inline`` has a number of useful attributes and methods, explained below.

.. attribute:: Inline.app_label

This attribute is automatically calculated using the same method that a Django model does.  However, if you wish, you can manually define it.

.. attribute:: Inline.default_template

It is generally good practice to give your inline the ability to load a custom, user-defined template.  However, you should define a default template.

.. attribute:: Inline.display_group

This controls how inlines are grouped in the admin.  Under the hood this is used to generate ``optgroup`` tags.  If you don't specify this, then ``app_label`` will be used automatically instead.

.. attribute:: Inline.form

A ``django.forms.Form`` subclass that is used to generate a form for the creation of a new inline.  You can use any form you like but it must define a render method that outputs the proper HTML to edit the inline in the admin interface.  Populous includes a convenient form class, InlineForm, for you to subclass which provides a render method.  You can also override ``get_form`` to provide more customized form generation; see :class:`~Inline.get_form`.


.. attribute:: Inline.name

This is the internal name for the inlines.  This needs to be unique when taken with :attr:`app_label<Inline.app_label>`.  
The default value is derived from the class name, so if your inline class is called ``TextInline``, its ``name`` 
attribute will be ``textinline``.

.. attribute:: Inline.verbose_name

The name of the inline as will appear in the admin.  If not defined, Populous will use a munged version of the class name: ``TextInline`` becomes ``text inline``.

.. attribute:: Inline.verbose_name_plural

Same as ``verbose_name`` but use when a plural form is needed.  If you don't define this, then an attempt at auto-pluralization will be made.

.. method:: Inline.get_form(request, content_type, field, obj_id=None)

If you override this method, you must make sure that it returns as valid subclass of ``InlineForm``.

Here is a slightly more complex inline than shown above::
    
    from django import forms
    from populous import inlines
    
    class ImageWithCaptionInlineForm(inlines.InlineForm):
        url = forms.URLField()  # URL to image
        caption = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextArea())
        open_in_popup = forms.BooleanField(required=False)

    class ImageWithCaptionInline(inlines.Inline):
        name = 'image with caption'
        form = ImageWithCaptionInlineForm


Installing Inlines
==================

Once you have created a new inline and have placed it in a file named ``inlines.py`` within your application's folder, the next time you run ``syncdb`` your new inline will automatically be installed.  Additionally, there are a few management commands that come with the inlines application, which include:

sync
----

.. django-admin:: inlines sync <appname appname ...>

Automatically detects and installs all inlines for the given application(s).  If no application name is provided then all inlines in all installed applications will be synced.

reset
-----

.. django-admin:: inlines reset <appname appname ...>

Removes and syncs all inlines for the given application(s).  If no application name is provided, all installed inlines in all installed applications will be reset and synced.
