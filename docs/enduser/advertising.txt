.. admonition:: Balancing power and ease of use

    As mentioned earlier, this software was designed with power and
    *ease of use* in mind.  Often it is difficult to find the appropriate
    balance between these two things.  This guide will attempt to help
    with any confusing parts of the application.

The advertising system is broken down into two main components;
``Advertising`` and ``Advertisements``.  The ``Advertising`` module
contains all of the functions related to managing the advertising
system, while the ``Advertisements`` modules contains all the
functionality regarding the actual advertisements.

Advertising
===========

The ``Advertising`` module contains *three* main components; ``Clients``, 
``Placements`` and ``Statistics``.  The ``Clients`` component, as it sounds,
allows for the administration of clients who have (or will in the near future)
run ads with us.  The ``Placements`` component controls which advertisements
show up on which site and page.  ``Placements`` are powerful and very flexible
but require some interaction between the advertising staff and the developers.
The ``Statistics`` component allows you to view statistics for both
``Advertisements`` as well as ``Placements``.

Clients
-------

Creating a client is pretty straight forward.  Under the ``Advertising`` module
you will see ``Clients``.  Clicking on this will take you to a page which
displays a list of current and past clients.

.. _`Creating a Client`:

To add a new client simply click on ``Add client`` in the top right and you will
be taken to a form which contains a bunch of fields to help identify and keep
track of your clients.  After filling out the appropriate fields, click ``save``.

Placements
----------

``Placements`` are the gateway through which ads are displayed on the website.
Placements are tied to *specific* locations on a website or multiple websites.
Because of this, **adding Placements in the admin interface is not supported**.
The reason for this is pretty simple; ``Placements`` are complicated and if not
created properly can *severely* damage the way in which the website loads.  It
is for this reason that we've decided that the advertising staff must come to the
development department in order to add new ``Placements``.

With that said, creating ``Placements`` is a fairly trivial exercise for those trained
to do so.  So don't be afraid to ask for a placement to be created if there is demand
for one!

Statistics
----------

Another new feature of this release is a ``Statistics`` component.  When an ad is created
(see `Creating an Ad`_) and added to a placement, a ``Statistic`` is automatically created.
This ``Statistic`` keeps track of the following for ad ``ad`` and placement ``placement``:


* Starting date of ``ad`` in ``placement``.
* Ending date of ``ad`` in ``placement`` (date ``ad`` stopped showing up in ``placement``).
* Number of ``impressions`` received by ``ad`` while running at ``placement``.
* Number of ``click-throughs`` received by ``ad`` while running at ``placement``.

These four attributes allow for a lot of information to be compiled for a certain ad and or
placement.


Advertisements
==============

The ``Advertisements`` module contains the different types of advertisements
which we can run on our websites.  There are four types of advertisements
that are available by default:

* ``Text Ads``
* ``Graphic Ads``
* ``Video Ads``
* ``Coupons``

These will be explained in further detail below; see `Creating an Ad`_.
