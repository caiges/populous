Messaging
=========

Populous comes with a comprehensive messaging system that includes the ability to
send messages through a variety of different protocols.

Protocols
=========
Populous comes with several built-in messaging protocols that you can take advantage
of.  These include:

 * E-mail
 * Private Message
 * Text Message (SMS)
 * Instant Message


Sending an Instant Message
==========================

Sending an instant message is very similar to how Django approaches sending
e-mail.  The following illustrates a simple case::

    from populous.messaging import InstantMessage
    msg = InstantMessage('Body goes here', [('AIM', 'aimusername')])
    msg.send()
    

Instant Messages
----------------

The ``InstantMessage`` class is initialized with the following parameters.  All
parameters are optional and can be set at any time prior to calling the
``send()`` method.

    * ``body``: The body text. This should be a plain text message.
    
    * ``to``: A list or tuple of recipient tuples (see note).
