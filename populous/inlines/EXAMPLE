Here is a basic example of how to create your own inline.

populous/news/inlines.py::

    from populous import inlines
    from populous.news.models import Story

    class StoryInline(inlines.ModelInline):
        model = Story
        raw_id_admin = False
        description = "This is a description of what this inline does."
        author = "Billy Bob"
